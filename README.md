Image dehazing is a vital process in image processing aimed at improving visibility in
hazyor foggy conditions (Li et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2021). By reducing the impact of 
atmospheric scattering, dehazing algorithms enhance image clarity and reveal hidden 
details. These techniques analyze pixel intensities and colors, employing mathematical 
models to estimate and remove haze-induced degradation (Li et al., 2019). Common
methods includedark channel prior (Golts et al., 2019) and atmospheric light estimation 
Zhu et al. (2021), effectively restoring image contrast and visibility. Dehazing finds 
applications in various fields, such as computer vision, surveillance, and remote sensing,
where clear and detailedimages are essential for accurate analysis and decision-making
(Agrawal and Jalal, 2022).
